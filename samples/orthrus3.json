It leverages splice isoforms and evolutionary orthologs to learn powerful representations of RNA. The resulting model significantly outperforms existing methods on various prediction tasks and demonstrates remarkable data efficiency.",

Panel B details the training pipeline, where a Mamba-based encoder learns to pull embeddings of related RNA pairs together. Panel C shows the evaluation strategy using linear probing and fine-tuning, with a UMAP plot hinting at the highly structured latent space learned by the model.",
