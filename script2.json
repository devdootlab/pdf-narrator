Using Nanopore long-read sequencing on 143 diverse melon accessions, the authors reconstructed the genomic regions containing these genes. Their findings revealed an unexpectedly high and unsaturated level of allelic diversity and led to the development of novel genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods that more accurately link this diversity to disease resistance.",

Second, novel graph- and k-mer-based GWAS are significantly more precise than standard methods for linking genes in these complex regions to resistance traits. And third, diversity estimation can effectively guide future research toward specific melon varieties and regions that are most likely to contain novel resistance alleles.",
